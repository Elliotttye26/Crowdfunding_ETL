# Crowdfunding_ETL

# The Challenge
Congratulations! You've decided to treat yourself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii. To help with your trip planning, you decide to do a climate analysis about the area. The following sections outline the steps that you need to take to accomplish this task.In this section, you’ll use Python and SQLAlchemy to do a basic climate analysis and data exploration of your climate database. Specifically, you’ll use SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib. Perform a precipitation analysis and then a station analysis.

# The Process
For the ETL mini project, we worked together to practice building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform the data. After you transform the data, you'll create four CSV files and use the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema. Finally, you’ll upload the CSV file data into a Postgres database. The bulk of the work came from building and creating dataframes. We spent the most time here and had the most difficult portion to work through in cleaning up sections of the dataframes when changing data types.

# What’s included?
Within this repo you will find my part one climate_starter.ipynb file within the first folder titled Starter_Code. To get to part 2 you will then open the folder Resources. There you will find the files named app.py, hawaii.sqlite, hawaii_measurements.csv, and hawaii_stations.csv. The file titled app.py will have the code used for part two and will run the url that is needed to get the results prompted. I have included photos of the different routes/web pages below.
